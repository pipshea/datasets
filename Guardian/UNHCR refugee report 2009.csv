"The refugee population is included in this table if the number was 5,000 or more at the end of 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"N.B. For 24 industrialized countries, UNHCR has estimated the refugee population based on 10 years of asylum-seeker recognition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The columns ""Major increases"" and ""Major decreases"" exclude population changes resulting from administrative corrections, adjustments as a result of registration, new estimates as well as births and deaths. In some cases, the population at the end of 2009 does not equal the population at the start of 2009 plus increases and decreases. This discrepancy is due to the fact that the voluntary repatriation figures include estimates from countries of return. In addition, the full details of the changes in the refugee population in industrialized countries are often unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Voluntary repatriation* shows a best estimate, based on country of asylum and country of origin reports. Numbers below 5 have been replaced with an asterisk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1 Afghan refugee figures for Pakistan include individually recognized Afghan refugees (2,800), registered Afghans in refugee villages who are assisted by UNHCR (756,000), and registered Afghans outside refugee villages who are living in a “refugee-like” situation (981,000). Individuals in all categories have been issued a Proof of Registration Card by the Government of Pakistan. Following the completion of the registration exercise in 2007, those living outside refugee villages are now in the “refugee-like” category. They do not receive direct UNHCR material assistance but they benefit from advocacy and reintegration support upon return.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
